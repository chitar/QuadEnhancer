# QuadEnhancer

This repository contains the source code for the paper *QuadEnhancer: Leveraging Quadratic Transformations to Enhance Deep Neural Networks*.

QuadEnhancer introduces quadratic transformations to improve the performance of deep neural networks. The repository provides implementations for the following tasks:
- [image classification](./image-classification)
- [text classification](./text-classification)
- [LLM finetuning](./LLM-finetuning)

Please follow the instructions in the respective directories for each task to set up and run the experiments.
